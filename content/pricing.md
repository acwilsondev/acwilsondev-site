## A Transparent Approach to Pricing

I believe in complete transparency when it comes to project costs. This pricing structure is designed to provide you with clear expectations about investment levels for different project scopes. Rather than hiding costs or surprising you with unexpected fees, I've outlined distinct tiers base

## Project Pricing Tiers

### Basic Web App ($7K–$15K)

**Best For:** MVPs, small business applications, and proof-of-concept projects.

- **SSO authentication (basic setup)** – OAuth2, OIDC, or simple JWT-based login.
- **NestJS API with PostgreSQL & Redis** – REST/GraphQL endpoints for data interactions.
- **Next.js frontend with Tailwind CSS** – Responsive, accessible UI with basic components.
- **Dockerized local environment** – Ready-to-run dev environment using Docker Compose.
- **Basic CI/CD pipeline** – GitHub Actions/GitLab CI for automated deployments.

📌 **Ideal for startups or small teams needing a quick launch without complex infrastructure.**

---

### Standard SaaS Backend ($15K–$30K)

**Best For:** Multi-user SaaS applications, business dashboards, and medium-scale cloud services.

- **Multi-tenancy support** – Isolated user data, organization-based authentication.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** – Fine-grained user permissions.
- **API Gateway with Kong or Traefik** – Rate limiting, request throttling, and centralized API management.
- **CI/CD automation with Terraform & ArgoCD** – Continuous integration with automated deployments.
- **Infrastructure monitoring & logging** – Prometheus, Grafana, Loki integration.

📌 **Designed for teams needing a scalable backend with strong user management and DevOps support.**

---

### Enterprise-Ready Deployment ($30K–$50K+)

**Best For:** High-performance, security-sensitive, or multi-cloud deployments.

- **Advanced Kubernetes deployment** – Multi-cloud, high-availability clusters.
- **Secrets management with Vault & SOPS** – Secure storage of API keys and credentials.
- **Performance & security hardening** – OWASP best practices, end-to-end encryption, security audits.
- **Custom AI/ML integrations** – If required, Python-based services for AI-powered features.
- **Full observability stack** – Logging, tracing, and proactive infrastructure health monitoring.

📌 **Ideal for companies needing full-scale security, scalability, and cloud-agnostic infrastructure.**

---

### Additional Add-Ons

- **Advanced Authentication & SSO** – $3K–$7K (Custom integrations with Okta, Auth0, Azure AD, etc.).
- **AI/ML Model Integration** – $5K+ (Custom model serving with FastAPI + TensorFlow/PyTorch).
- **DevOps as a Service** – $2K+/month (Ongoing infrastructure monitoring, security patching, and automated scaling).
