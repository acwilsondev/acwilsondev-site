# My Mission

I exist to create technology and knowledge that empower individuals, foster open collaboration, and challenge restrictive systems. Rooted in curiosity and hands-on experimentation, my work prioritizes transparency, accessibility, and practical solutions that enable others. By rejecting unnecessary bureaucracy, advocating for open systems, and designing for inclusivity, I ensure that my work contributes to a broader culture of knowledge-sharing and empowerment.

## My Vision

To build a future where open systems and accessible technologies drive innovation and empower all users—eliminating barriers and amplifying creative solutions across industries.

## Core Values

### Encourage Open Systems

I believe in the power of open systems and transparent processes. I favor transparency, collaboration, open-source standards, and user freedom while avoiding projects that promote excessive secrecy or vendor lock-in.

### Enable Others

My success is measured by your success. I design solutions with reusability and extensibility, providing thorough documentation and mentorship rather than hoarding knowledge or relying on dependency-based business models.

### Challenge Bureaucracy

I question centralized control, reduce gatekeeping, and streamline workflows. I refuse to accept work that imposes unnecessary constraints on users or perpetuates inefficient processes.

### Engineer for Empowerment

I prioritize usability, accessibility, and inclusivity in everything I build. My goal is to minimize barriers and create technology that includes and uplifts users rather than excludes or marginalizes them.

### Tinker First, Ask Later

I embrace curiosity, experimentation, and hands-on learning. Rather than overplanning to the point of stifling innovation, I believe in practical exploration as a path to discovery and problem-solving.

## My Approach

Combining a hands-on, experimental mindset with a commitment to open systems and collaboration, I deliver robust, scalable solutions that empower clients and end-users—without the drag of excessive bureaucracy. My approach ensures that my solutions are:

- **Accessible**: Clear documentation and inclusive design that eliminates barriers
- **Transparent**: Open processes and communication that build trust and understanding
- **Sustainable**: Built for long-term success with minimal maintenance overhead
- **Empowering**: Designed to enhance your capabilities rather than create dependencies
- **Scalable**: Flexible systems that evolve with your changing needs

Whether you're looking to build a new system, improve existing infrastructure, or learn about the latest in technology, I'm here to help you succeed.
