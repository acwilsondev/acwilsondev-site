# Our Mission

AC Wilson exists to create technology and knowledge that empower individuals, foster open collaboration, and challenge restrictive systems. Rooted in curiosity and hands-on experimentation, this business prioritizes transparency, accessibility, and practical solutions that enable others. By rejecting unnecessary bureaucracy, advocating for open systems, and designing for inclusivity, AC Wilson ensures that its work contributes to a broader culture of knowledge-sharing and empowerment.

## Our Vision

To build a future where open systems and accessible technologies drive innovation and empower all users—eliminating barriers and amplifying creative solutions across industries.

## Core Values

### Encourage Open Systems

We believe in the power of open systems and transparent processes. We favor transparency, collaboration, open-source standards, and user freedom while avoiding projects that promote excessive secrecy or vendor lock-in.

### Enable Others

Our success is measured by your success. We design solutions with reusability and extensibility, providing thorough documentation and mentorship rather than hoarding knowledge or relying on dependency-based business models.

### Challenge Bureaucracy

We question centralized control, reduce gatekeeping, and streamline workflows. We refuse to accept work that imposes unnecessary constraints on users or perpetuates inefficient processes.

### Engineer for Empowerment

We prioritize usability, accessibility, and inclusivity in everything we build. Our goal is to minimize barriers and create technology that includes and uplifts users rather than excludes or marginalizes them.

### Tinker First, Ask Later

We embrace curiosity, experimentation, and hands-on learning. Rather than overplanning to the point of stifling innovation, we believe in practical exploration as a path to discovery and problem-solving.

## Our Approach

Combining a hands-on, experimental mindset with a commitment to open systems and collaboration, we deliver robust, scalable solutions that empower clients and end-users—without the drag of excessive bureaucracy. Our approach ensures that our solutions are:

- **Accessible**: Clear documentation and inclusive design that eliminates barriers
- **Transparent**: Open processes and communication that build trust and understanding
- **Sustainable**: Built for long-term success with minimal maintenance overhead
- **Empowering**: Designed to enhance your capabilities rather than create dependencies
- **Scalable**: Flexible systems that evolve with your changing needs

Whether you're looking to build a new system, improve existing infrastructure, or learn about the latest in technology, we're here to help you succeed.
