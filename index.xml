&lt;p>In the spirit of open knowledge sharing and enabling others, let&amp;rsquo;s explore continuous deployment (CD) - what it is, why it matters, and how to implement it effectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-continuous-deployment">What is Continuous Deployment?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Continuous Deployment is an approach where code changes are automatically deployed to production after passing automated testing. It&amp;rsquo;s the natural evolution of Continuous Integration (CI) and represents a commitment to automation and quality.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About</title><link>/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/about/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="my-mission">My Mission&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m here to create technology and knowledge that empower individuals, foster open collaboration, and challenge restrictive systems. Rooted in curiosity and hands-on experimentation, my work prioritizes transparency, accessibility, and practical solutions that enable others. By rejecting unnecessary bureaucracy, advocating for open systems, and designing for inclusivity, I ensure that my work contributes to a broader culture of knowledge-sharing and empowerment.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="core-values">Core Values&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Encourage Open Systems&lt;/strong>: I believe in the power of open systems and transparent processes. I favor transparency, collaboration, open-source standards, and user freedom while avoiding projects that promote excessive secrecy or vendor lock-in.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Enable Others&lt;/strong>: My success is measured by your success. I design solutions with reusability and extensibility, providing thorough documentation and mentorship rather than hoarding knowledge or relying on dependency-based business models.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Challenge Bureaucracy&lt;/strong>: I question centralized control, reduce gatekeeping, and streamline workflows. I refuse to accept work that imposes unnecessary constraints on users or perpetuates inefficient processes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Engineer for Empowerment&lt;/strong>: I prioritize usability, accessibility, and inclusivity in everything I build. My goal is to minimize barriers and create technology that includes and uplifts users rather than excludes or marginalizes them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Tinker First, Ask Questions Later&lt;/strong>: I embrace curiosity, experimentation, and hands-on learning. Rather than overplanning to the point of stifling innovation, I believe in practical exploration as a path to discovery and problem-solving.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="my-approach">My Approach&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Combining a hands-on, experimental mindset with a commitment to open systems and collaboration, I deliver robust, scalable solutions that empower clients and end-usersâ€”without the drag of excessive bureaucracy. My approach ensures that my solutions are:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/contact/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Services</title><link>/services/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/services/</guid><description>&lt;p>I offer a comprehensive range of technology services designed to empower your organization and drive business success.
